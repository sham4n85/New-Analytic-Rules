# Security Analysis Report: High CPU Usage in Firewall
## Threat Analysis & Framework Mapping

### Description
High CPU usage in firewall devices can indicate various security concerns including DDoS attacks, malware infection, or misconfiguration. This condition requires immediate attention as it may lead to degraded network performance or complete failure of security controls.

### Framework Mappings
- **MITRE ATT&CK**
  - T1498: Network Denial of Service
  - T1499: Endpoint Denial of Service
  - T1496: Resource Hijacking

- **ISO 27001**
  - A.12.1.3: Capacity Management
  - A.12.4: Logging and Monitoring
  - A.16.1: Management of Information Security Incidents

- **NIS 2**
  - Article 21: Risk Management Measures
  - Article 23: Reporting Obligations

- **DORA**
  - Article 6: Risk Management
  - Article 11: ICT Third-party Risk Management

- **PCI DSS 4.0**
  - Requirement 1: Install and Maintain Network Security Controls
  - Requirement 10: Log and Monitor All Access to System Components

- **SOC 2**
  - CC7.2: Monitoring Security Events
  - CC7.3: Security Incident Response

## Log Sources & Monitoring

### Primary Log Sources
1. **Cisco ASA**
   ```
   - System logs: %ASA-1-101001
   - CPU monitoring: %ASA-4-733100
   - Performance metrics: %ASA-6-747006
   ```

2. **Fortinet FortiGate**
   ```
   - CPU usage: date=2024-01-20 time=15:30:00 devname="FG100F" device_id=FG100F... cpu=98
   - System performance: date=2024-01-20 time=15:30:00 type="perf" cpu_usage="high"
   ```

3. **F5 BIG-IP**
   ```
   - CPU statistics: "hostname":"bigip1.example.com","cpu_usage_ratio":95
   - System warnings: "level":"warning","message":"CPU utilization exceeded threshold"
   ```

## Detection Queries

### Microsoft Sentinel KQL Query
```kql
let threshold = 80;
union 
    (CommonSecurityLog
    | where DeviceVendor in ("Cisco", "Fortinet", "F5")
    | where DeviceAction contains "CPU"
    | extend CPU_Usage = extract("cpu=([0-9]+)", 1, AdditionalExtensions)),
    (Syslog
    | where ProcessName in ("ASA", "fortigate", "big-ip")
    | where SyslogMessage contains "CPU")
| where CPU_Usage > threshold
| project TimeGenerated, DeviceVendor, DeviceName, CPU_Usage, SyslogMessage
| sort by TimeGenerated desc
```

### Microsoft Defender Advanced Hunting Query
```kql
let timeframe = 1h;
DeviceEvents
| where Timestamp > ago(timeframe)
| where DeviceType == "NetworkDevice"
| where AdditionalFields has "CPU"
| extend CPU_Usage = toint(extract("CPU=([0-9]+)", 1, AdditionalFields))
| where CPU_Usage > 80
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, CPU_Usage, ReportId, InitiatingProcessAccountName
```

## Incident Response Flowchart

1. **Initial Detection (0-15 minutes)**
   - Monitor alerts for high CPU usage
   - Verify alert authenticity
   - Create incident ticket

2. **Triage (15-30 minutes)**
   - Check current CPU usage and trends
   - Identify affected services
   - Determine business impact
   - Escalate if CPU usage > 90%

3. **Investigation (30-60 minutes)**
   - Analyze traffic patterns
   - Check for DDoS indicators
   - Review recent configuration changes
   - Examine connection tables
   - Verify security policy effectiveness

4. **Containment (60-90 minutes)**
   - Apply traffic filtering if attack detected
   - Implement rate limiting
   - Enable conservative security policies
   - Activate backup systems if needed

5. **Resolution (90-120 minutes)**
   - Address root cause
   - Implement fixes
   - Verify system stability
   - Document incident

## IT Team Instructions

### Immediate Actions
1. Access the firewall management interface
2. Run `show processes cpu-usage` (Cisco ASA) or equivalent
3. Identify top CPU-consuming processes
4. Check connection table status

### Investigation Steps
1. Review system logs for errors or warnings
2. Analyze traffic patterns using NetFlow data
3. Verify recent configuration changes
4. Check memory utilization

### Mitigation Actions
1. If DDoS detected:
   - Enable threat protection features
   - Apply rate limiting
   - Contact upstream provider

2. If misconfiguration identified:
   - Review and optimize security policies
   - Adjust session timeouts
   - Verify NAT configurations

3. If legitimate traffic:
   - Implement load balancing
   - Consider capacity upgrade
   - Optimize configurations

### Recovery Steps
1. Monitor system performance
2. Verify service restoration
3. Update documentation
4. Schedule preventive maintenance

### Post-Incident
1. Document root cause
2. Update monitoring thresholds
3. Review and update procedures
4. Schedule security assessment
