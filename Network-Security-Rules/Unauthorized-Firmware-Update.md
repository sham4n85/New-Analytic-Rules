## 4. IT Team Instructions

### Immediate Actions
1. ISOLATE affected systems from network immediately
   - Disconnect network cables
   - Disable wireless interfaces
   - Document current network connections before disconnection

2. DISABLE USB ports
   - Use Group Policy or endpoint management tools
   - Physical blocking if necessary
   - Document any connected USB devices

3. BLOCK source IP
   - Update firewall rules
   - Document blocked IP for investigation
   - Monitor for lateral movement attempts

4. COLLECT logs
   - System event logs
   - Network traffic logs
   - SIEM alerts
   - Physical access logs

### Investigation Procedure
