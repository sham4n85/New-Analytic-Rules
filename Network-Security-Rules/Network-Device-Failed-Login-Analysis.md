## Log Sources & Configuration

### Cisco ASA
```
logging enable
logging trap informational
logging host inside [SIEM-IP]
logging facility local4
logging timestamp
logging permit-hostdown
```

### FortiGate
```
config log syslogd setting
    set status enable
    set server [SIEM-IP]
    set facility local4
    set source-ip [FORTIGATE-IP]
end
```

### F5 BIG-IP
```
sys syslog {
    remote-servers {
        remote_server {
            host [SIEM-IP]
            local-ip [F5-IP]
            remote-port 514
        }
    }
}
```

## IT Team Instructions

### Immediate Actions (0-30 minutes)
1. VALIDATE the alert by checking:
   - Number of failed attempts
   - Source IP addresses
   - Targeted accounts
   - Time window of attempts

2. CONTAIN the threat:
   - Block source IP addresses at the firewall
   - Enable additional logging for affected devices
   - Lock affected accounts if suspicious activity confirmed

### Investigation Phase (30-120 minutes)
1. COLLECT evidence:
   - Authentication logs from all network devices
   - Network flow data
   - Related security events

2. ANALYZE attack pattern:
   - Geographic location of source IPs
   - Attack timing and frequency
   - Common usernames attempted
   - Attack tool signatures

### Remediation Steps
1. IMPLEMENT security hardening:
   - Enable multi-factor authentication
   - Review and update access control lists
   - Implement rate limiting for authentication attempts
   - Update password policies

2. DOCUMENT findings:
   - Attack timeline
   - Affected systems
   - Actions taken
   - Recommendations for prevention

### Prevention Measures
1. ENHANCE monitoring:
   - Adjust alert thresholds if needed
   - Implement additional logging
   - Configure automated responses

2. UPDATE procedures:
   - Review and update incident response playbook
   - Conduct team training on new measures
   - Schedule regular security assessments

## Additional Notes
- All actions must be documented in the ticketing system
- Updates to management required for high-severity incidents
- Post-incident review meeting required within 48 hours
- Update threat intelligence feeds with indicators
