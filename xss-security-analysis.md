# Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Security Analysis and Detection Strategy

## Threat Analysis

### Attack Vectors
1. **Reflected XSS**
   - Entry points: URL parameters, search fields, form inputs
   - Attack method: Malicious scripts injected via URL parameters
   - Impact: Session hijacking, credential theft
   
2. **Stored XSS**
   - Entry points: User profiles, comments, database-stored content
   - Attack method: Persistent malicious scripts stored in database
   - Impact: Mass user compromise, persistent threats
   
3. **DOM-based XSS**
   - Entry points: Client-side JavaScript manipulation
   - Attack method: Manipulation of DOM elements through user input
   - Impact: Client-side data exposure, session compromise

### Risk Assessment
1. **Critical Risks**
   - Session token theft
   - Credential compromise
   - Data exfiltration
   - Website defacement
   - Malware distribution

2. **Attack Scenarios**
   - Phishing campaigns using reflected XSS
   - Mass user compromise through stored XSS
   - Targeted attacks using DOM manipulation

## Analytics Rules

### Rule 1: Reflected XSS Detection
- Name: DETECT_Reflected_XSS_Attempts
- Severity: High
- Description: Detects potential reflected XSS attempts in HTTP requests
- Logic: Monitor for script tags, JavaScript events in URL parameters
- Threshold: 3 attempts within 5 minutes from same source IP

### Rule 2: Stored XSS Detection
- Name: DETECT_Stored_XSS_Patterns
- Severity: Critical
- Description: Identifies malicious scripts in stored data
- Logic: Scan for script patterns in database inputs
- Threshold: Any occurrence

### Rule 3: DOM XSS Detection
- Name: DETECT_DOM_XSS_Manipulation
- Severity: High
- Description: Monitors DOM manipulation attempts
- Logic: Track suspicious document.write() calls
- Threshold: 5 manipulations per minute

### Rule 4: XSS Cookie Theft Detection
- Name: DETECT_XSS_Cookie_Exfiltration
- Severity: Critical
- Description: Identifies potential cookie theft via XSS
- Logic: Monitor for cookie access patterns
- Threshold: Unusual cookie access patterns

## KQL Queries

### Query 1: Detect Reflected XSS Attempts
```kusto
SecurityEvent
| where TimeGenerated > ago(1h)
| where HttpRequest contains "<script"
    or HttpRequest contains "javascript:"
    or HttpRequest contains "onerror="
    or HttpRequest contains "onload="
| project TimeGenerated, SourceIP, HttpRequest, UserAgent
| summarize AttemptsCount=count() by SourceIP, bin(TimeGenerated, 5m)
| where AttemptsCount >= 3
```

### Query 2: Monitor Stored XSS Patterns
```kusto
DatabaseEvents
| where TimeGenerated > ago(24h)
| where Operation == "Insert" or Operation == "Update"
| where PayloadData contains "<script"
    or PayloadData contains "javascript:"
    or PayloadData contains "eval("
| project TimeGenerated, DatabaseName, TableName, PayloadData, UserIdentity
```

### Query 3: Track DOM Manipulation
```kusto
BrowserEvents
| where TimeGenerated > ago(1h)
| where EventType == "DOMManipulation"
| where EventData contains "document.write"
    or EventData contains "innerHTML"
    or EventData contains "insertAdjacentHTML"
| summarize ManipulationCount=count() by UserID, bin(TimeGenerated, 1m)
| where ManipulationCount >= 5
```

### Query 4: Cookie Exfiltration Detection
```kusto
SecurityEvent
| where TimeGenerated > ago(1h)
| where EventType == "CookieAccess"
| where HttpRequest contains "document.cookie"
| project TimeGenerated, SourceIP, CookieData, UserAgent
| join kind=inner (
    SecurityEvent
    | where EventType == "NetworkConnection"
    | where DestinationIP !in (trusted_domains)
) on SourceIP
```

## Prevention Recommendations

1. **Input Validation**
   - Implement strict input validation on all user inputs
   - Use whitelisting approach for allowed characters
   - Validate on both client and server side

2. **Output Encoding**
   - Implement context-specific output encoding
   - Use HTML encoding for HTML contexts
   - Use JavaScript encoding for JS contexts

3. **Security Headers**
   - Implement Content Security Policy (CSP)
   - Enable X-XSS-Protection header
   - Set HTTPOnly flag on sensitive cookies

4. **Response Monitoring**
   - Implement real-time response monitoring
   - Set up alerts for detected XSS patterns
   - Establish incident response procedures

5. **Regular Security Testing**
   - Conduct regular security assessments
   - Perform automated XSS scanning
   - Implement penetration testing program

## Incident Response Plan

1. **Detection Phase**
   - Monitor security alerts from analytics rules
   - Analyze KQL query results
   - Investigate suspicious patterns

2. **Containment Phase**
   - Block malicious IP addresses
   - Remove compromised content
   - Reset affected user sessions

3. **Eradication Phase**
   - Patch vulnerable code
   - Update security controls
   - Strengthen input validation

4. **Recovery Phase**
   - Restore clean data backups
   - Verify system integrity
   - Monitor for recurring issues

5. **Lessons Learned**
   - Document incident details
   - Update security controls
   - Enhance detection rules
